# Blue-Genesis (QHacks 2024)

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pe-9AhXssI

Steps to start the website out

1. Make the first terminal, cd into OH24 --> AI_art_generator and type "python .\manage.py runserver" in the terminal.

2. Make the second terminal, cd into QH24 --> AI_art_generator --> frontend and type "npm run dev" in the terminal.

3. Then run server through the first terminal with the provided host link.

4. In the API folder (QH24/AI_art_generator/api) open the views.py file and insert your OWN OpenAI API key for the generator to work. Due to the risk of our API key being leaked if we push it in a public domain (Github) we cannot push it onto the github and can only do it in person.
